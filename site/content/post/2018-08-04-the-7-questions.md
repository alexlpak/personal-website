If you want a satisfying relationship that withholds nothing and honors Christ, take some time with your spouse/boyfriend or girlfriend  to ask these questions every week. Jefferson Bethke and his wife provided this template. I know that asking these questions from the beginning of my relationship with Hannah has provided a solid foundation and culture of trust and love.

1. **What was one thing that brought you joy this week?**
2. **What was one thing that was hard this week?**
3. **What is one specific thing I can do for you this week?**
4. **How can I pray for you this week?**
5. **Is there anything that's gone unsaid, convictions, confessions or unresolved hurt?**
6. **What's a dream or desire or thought that's been on the forefront of your mind this week?**
7. **How are we doing, stewarding, and feeling about our finances (we only ask this one about every 4-6 weeks)?**
