_Here are some lies that we sometimes believe. This was sent to me by my counselor, and I wanted to share it with you. The author is unknown at the moment._

__

**1. I must be perfect.**

We all make mistakes; it is just part of being human.  Perfectionists set unrealistically high standards, which guarantees failure.  It creates depression and/or anxiety and if applied to relationships, it creates stress and strain with the person.  Typically, they think it works in their favor and if they lower their standards, they will become a slob or worthless.  It is a proven fact that encouraged people are much more successful than discouraged and perfectionists will always ultimately end up discouraged.  Sometimes perfectionists believe that if they could just be perfect then people will love or accept them and if they are not perfect then people will abandon them.



**2. I must have everyone else's love and approval.**

This belief causes problems because we cannot control whether we have everyone else's love and approval.  If we live our life to please other people, we will not end up successful and we will most assuredly make ourselves miserable.  Each of us is called to please God and follow the unique blueprint that He has for us.  If we live to please others then we give up our own identity and in the end don't know who we really are.

****

**3. It is better to avoid problems than to face them.**

Avoiding problems is part of our human nature, but some of us carry it to an unhealthy extreme.  We believe that if we have a problem and don't think about it then, it will magically go way.  Sometimes problems do go away on their own but some problems get worse if we don't deal with them.  We need to develop both wayside of dealing with problems because some problems are best confronted and some problems work themselves out on their own but if we only have one style of approaching problems, it will not fit all situations.  We also need to be able to discern with each problem which is the best way to deal with it.

****

**4. Things have to go my way for me to be happy.**

This belief it is in direct conflict with reality because the world will not conform to what we want and we need to develop strategies to be happy even when we don't get our way or we will be unhappy most of our life.  This belief creates the need for constant control over everything around us, which is impossible.  People who believe this lie think the world should revolve around them.  This belief gets in the way of empathy for others and makes us miserable.  Also, with this belief we give away any power we have over our own happiness.

****

**5. My happiness is externally caused.**

This belief causes us to give away all of our power because our happiness depends upon things we have no control over.  When we have an outward focus for our happiness, we neglect the many ways we can make our life better with things that are within our control.  It also leads to blaming others for our unhappiness and can make us blind to see our contribution to the problems in our life.

****

**6. I am basically defective and inferior to other people.**

God says that we are all precious in His eyes and no person has greater worth than another.  God has stated emphatically that He carefully and uniquely designed each of us before He created the universe; we were created in His mind.  When we make a mistake or are not successful if we see this as a sign of being defective, then we will not learn from our mistakes or improve our preparation for success.  God created each of us with flaws, so no one is perfect.

****

**7. I'm only as good as what I do.**

Our self-worth comes from God and should not be based on what we do.  God created us in His image and before we ever do anything, our worth is established as precious.  In America we all seem to see our identity as what we do rather than finding our identity in God.  Believing this lie will create unstable self-esteem.

****

**8. Life should be easy.**

How much evidence do you have to support this lie?  If we believe this lie, then we will continually be surprised and frustrated because life will not be easy and it will cause us to have unrealistic expectations.  This lie is in direct conflict with reality.  In the Bible Jesus said that life would be difficult and that in the difficulty his strength and power can be manifest.  When life is difficult, it is a great opportunity to deepen our faith and to depend on God even more.  God never promised that he will make life easy but he does promise that he will never leave us and that he will support us during the difficulty.

****

**9. Life should be fair.**

This belief also goes directly against reality and the problem is that each of us has our own idea of what is fair.  When someone says something is not fair, what that really means is “I'm not getting my way”.  If we focus too much on the idea of "fair" it is a guarantee that we will be miserable.  In this life things are not always fair, and the sooner we accept it and make our decisions accordingly, the better our life will be.

****

**10. I should not have to wait for what I want.**

Instant gratification seems to be the primary focus for the day in this country.  Nothing of value is obtained without planning and effort. This lie makes us all short-term thinkers, where we don't consider the long-term consequences of our choices.  It is important to realize that much of our anxiety and unhappiness comes from impatience.  The only way to develop patience is by having to wait for what we want and then learning to handle the negative emotions that come from having to wait.  This belief is in direct conflict with the reality of the world.

****

**11. It is better to do what feels good now than plan to work for something better.**

This is similar to belief #10 and leads to short-term thinking rather than long-term thinking.  We will never be able to reach any goals if our decisions are controlled by our feelings.  Feelings are so unstable that if we use them to guide our life, we end up just running around in a circle, using a lot of energy but going nowhere.  This also comes from the need for instant gratification.

****

**12. My relationship problems are the other person's fault.**

It seems to be much easier to blame the other person for our negative feelings or behavior.  That is a cop-out because we can always choose how we react to things that happen in our lives.  This belief blinds us from taking our own inventory and making changes in ourselves that would help our relationships be healthier. In every troubled relationship, both people co- construct the relationship and contribute to problems, as well as the good things.  Because the other person is reacting to us as we react to him, if we change what we do it is likely the other person will change his reaction.  One of the main roadblocks to healthy relationships is escalation, which occurs when one person is perceived as saying something negative and the other person responds with an even more negative reaction.  Either person can prevent escalation.

****

**13. If my relationships take work, it means I should give up on them.**

Some relationships should be terminated if they are toxic but many times difficulties in the relationship give us the opportunity to grow and develop better coping skills.  If the relationship is an intimate one, and we give up on it, it is likely that we will take all of our baggage into a new relationship. If we let go of the baggage we have, it is likely that we could make the current relationship work well.  Relationships are difficult and we have to work at any meaningful relationship for it to be healthy and fulfilling. When you try to blend two very different people into one, it always takes work.

****

**14. My relationships should meet all my needs.**

If we try to get all of our needs met from a relationship, it is likely to put so much pressure on the relationship that it will collapse.  When we put so much pressure on another person to meet all of our needs and they are unable to meet them, we end up feeling resentful and the other person feels frustrated and powerless.  It is impossible for anyone to meet all of our needs.  God wants us to turn to him to meet our needs not another person.  God is the only one that can fill that empty void of loneliness and self-worth.  If we believe that a relationship should meet all of our needs then we are unable to appreciate what that relationship does offer us, and be grateful for that.

****

**15. I depend on my significant other to make me feel good about myself.**

No one can make us feel good or bad about ourselves. We have to take responsibility for our own feelings about ourselves.  When we have the proper self-esteem that comes from God’s view of us and his unconditional love, then we will not depend on validation from others.  We can never depend on others to give us worth and if we do, we will not get the validation we desire.  We have no control over whether our significant other makes us feel good, so if we depend on them, we will give away our power to determine how we feel about ourselves.

****

**16. I should not have to change to make my relationships work.**

Anytime we are involved in a close relationship it requires compromise and “give and take”.  When you try to merge two diverse people into one, there is some loss of self and getting our way in order to become compatible with another person.  If we love someone, then we must be willing to change certain things to make the relationship prosper. If a relationship causes us to change in Christ-like ways, then it is a good thing and will bring about personal growth.  It is a matter of balance because it is not healthy to change everything about who we are to please another.  We need to be willing to change anything about ourselves to please God.

****

**17. My significant other should think and feel just like me.**

Some people think that if their significant other does not see everything the same way as they do, then it means that they are incompatible.  No two people are going to think or feel the same way about everything.  We can become a more whole person and learn from people that look at things differently than we do.  It would be very boring if everyone thinks and feels just like us.  God must love diversity because he created everyone to be unique and different.  When we are exposed to other ways of thinking, it helps us to understand other people and develop more empathy for them.

****

**18. I often make mountains out of mole hills.**

This is more of a reaction than a belief but there is a belief behind it.  If we treat every day life events as if they are catastrophes, then we live our lives with all sorts of negative emotions.  Typically, people are able to more accurately evaluate how important something is the next day.  They usually admit that they made a big deal over something that was unimportant but they have difficulty having that perspective when things happen.  It helps to remind yourself when you get upset that tomorrow this will probably not be a big deal and "I might as well save the grief and see it that way now".  If we overreact to everyday life events and if it takes us a day or two to get over it, then we will spend our entire life being unhappy for nothing.  This reaction probably comes from a belief that life should go my way and an expectation that it will.

****

**19. I often take things too personally.**

People that take things too personally are the most miserable people in the world because they are always hurt or angry with someone.  When we take things too personally two things happen: someone does something to hurt our feelings and we assume that they hurt us on purpose.  The second thing is the one that causes us the most trouble because typically if someone hurts us they don't do it to on purpose.  Most of the time they do it because they don't think about us at all.  There are several ways to take things less personally including:

* Realize that we are not alone in our hurt and that thousands if not millions of people have experienced the same hurt.
* Realize that when someone hurts us, it has to do with their unresolved issues and problems and has very little to do with us.
* Realize that many times how people treat us depends upon the role that we play in their lives and that their reaction has to do with what we represent to them.  For example, when a parent disciplines their child, many times the child feels like their parent is trying to make them unhappy but the parent’s behavior is determined by being in the role of parent.
* Realize that many times God uses other people's behavior to teach us and to help us develop certain Christ-like characteristics.  God could be using that hurtful person to help us develop patience, empathy, or self-control.
* Realize that many times our hurt and the way we react indicates some unresolved issues on our part and the hurt can show us what areas we need to work on.
* Realize that there are many ways to look at something and when we get stuck looking at a situation in a way that causes us to feel hurt or angry, we can step back and find an alternative way to look at it.

****

**20. Things are black and white to me and there is no in between.**

Black-and-white thinkers tend to be very rigid in how they see the world.  The truth is that life is primarily lived in gray areas and no one or no situation is all good or all bad.  Perfectionism leads to black-and-white thinking because unless we are perfect, we are a total failure.   Another example is when someone goes on a diet and gets off track by eating a piece of cake, then they see their behavior as a total failure and tell themselves “I might as well eat the whole cake”.

****

**21. I can't change because I have always been this way.**

Humans have a great capacity to change themselves in many different areas.  What we need is sufficient motivation and a clear plan as to how to change and we can accomplish significant changes.  We can change ourselves but we cannot change anybody else. However by changing ourselves, we can influence people into significant changes.  We can change our behavior, our thoughts, our self talk, our reaction to things, and how we look at things.  We can develop new habits by changing the things we do because anything that we practice over and over again will become a habit.

****

**22. I often make decisions on my feelings rather than facts.**

In deciding what to trust and what to base our reality upon, we face the decision of whether to trust our feelings or the facts.  Because feelings are so unstable and do not have to be grounded in any reality, they can lead us down the wrong path.  Our feelings can be in direct opposition to reality and if we trust them over the reality or facts, we eventually will come crashing into what is real.  If we disregard our feelings then we lose an important source of information that we need to make good decisions but they should never be put in charge of what we do.  Feelings are a good servant but terrible masters.

****

**23. God's love can be earned.**

The only way we can earn God's love is to be perfect.  No matter what we do, God will never love us more and no matter what we do, God will never love us less.  God's love is given unconditionally because of who he is not because of what we do.  It was necessary for Jesus to die on the cross to pay the price of our sin and we cannot do enough good to earn or deserve God's love.

****

**24. God hates the sin and the sinner.**

The Bible makes it clear that God hates our sin but that he loves the sinner.  He was willing to pay the highest price, the death of his son, because of his love for us even when we were sinners.

****

**25. Because I'm a Christian, God will protect me from pain and suffering.**

This belief is not supported by any evidence because Christians and non-Christians experience pain and suffering at the same rate.  God promises to go through difficult circumstances with us but he does not promise to keep us from having to go through struggles.  If we look at the life of Jesus and the apostles we will see that their lives were very difficult and that they suffered in many ways.  Jesus even said that life will be difficult.  All of God's promises for joy, peace, and harmony are internal promises not external.  There will never be peace in the world but we can have peace in our hearts.

****

**26. All my problems are caused by my sin.**

Some of our problems are caused by our sin but because we live in a sinful world we will also have problems because of the evil in man's heart.  As mentioned earlier struggle is the natural result of giving men free will.  We always bring about problems and pain when we choose to go against God's will but that is not the cause of all of our pain and problems.

****

**27. The problems in my life are caused by God punishing me for my sins.**

God loves us and does not have joy in our pain.  God does not often cause our pain but his desire is always to use the pain to teach us and sanctify us.  Most of our pain comes from our disobedience or the disobedience of other people and the natural consequences of the choices we make.  God will always use the most loving and compassionate way to teach us and discipline us.  

****

**28. It is my Christian duty to meet all the needs of other people.**

It is our Christian duty to please God and not other people.  If we live our lives to please God, then we will generally be at harmony with everyone else.  If we live to please others or meet all their needs, we will make ourselves miserable and deny them of the opportunity for God to meet their needs.  Sometimes the most loving thing we can do is say no to another person.

****

**29. Painful emotions such as anger, depression and anxiety are signs that my faith in God is weak.**

No feelings are good or bad but what we do about our feelings can be.  God gave us a full range of emotions that when expressed at the appropriate time, in the appropriate way, and to the appropriate person, can help us take an effective action.  Pretending that we don't feel something or stuffing the feelings will only result in a volcanic eruption at an inappropriate time.  Stuffing your feelings can also have negative effects on your health.  We don't get to choose our feelings but we can always choose how we respond to them.  Painful feelings can motivate us and give us energy to take the appropriate action.  If we struggle with chronic negative emotions that don't fit the current situation, then it is likely that we have unfinished business that we need to work on.

****

**30. God cannot use me unless I am spiritually strong.**

The Bible is full of God using imperfect people to accomplish his will.  David was said to be a man after God's own heart but he committed murder and adultery and many times was spiritually weak.  Peter denied even knowing Christ three separate times prior to Christ's crucifixion.  After this Peter was a humiliated and defeated man but God was able to use him in his humility even better.  God consistently used frail and spiritually weak people because in their weakness His strength was able to be manifested.

****

**31. I am responsible for other people's feelings.**

We should never feel responsible over anything over which we have no control.  It is much like the weatherman feeling responsible for the weather.  Each person is responsible for his own behavior and feelings.  When we treat people with respect, kindness, and our responsibility ends for how they feel.

****

**32. I must be in control at all times.**

Usually people who need control over everything in their world do it to control their anxiety.  Control is an illusion because we can never really achieve it.  When things feel out of control, it creates a high level of anxiety.  The problem is that when we try to get rid of our anxiety through control, it makes us more anxious when we do not get it.  Control is a big waste of energy and time and tends to set us up to be angry.

****

**33. It is wrong to celebrate my successes or give myself credit for them.**

It is important to celebrate any small successes so that you will feel motivated to make more progress.  If we discount or minimize progress, then we discourage ourselves and our motivation goes down to make more progress.  It is not prideful or arrogant to pat ourselves on the back when we achieve something because it increases the chances of continued success.

****

**34. It is wrong to love myself.**

It says in the Bible that we are to love our neighbor as we love ourselves, which implies or assumes that we love ourselves.  When we love ourselves it promotes proper self-care and making decisions that are healthy.  Comparing ourselves but when we compare ourselves to others.  We get into trouble by comparing ourselves to other people it will either cause us to feel envy and jealousy or superiority and arrogance.  It is only through loving ourselves that we can truly love others in a healthy way.

****

**35. If I worry about something it will make the problem better.**

Some people mistakenly believe that if they worry about a problem it means that they are working on it or making it better.  The only thing that makes a problem better is taking some type of positive action to make it better.  Destructive worry causes us to be frozen, where helpful worry stimulates us into action.  Worrying about a problem but doing nothing drains our energy in a unproductive way.e away our power to determine how we feel about ourselves.
