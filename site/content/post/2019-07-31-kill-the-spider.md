A faith-filled, powerful prayer from "Kill the Spider: Getting Rid of What's Really Holding You Back" by Carlos Whittaker.

"Father, Christ, & Spirit . . .  I come to be restored in You, renewed in You, and brought back to receive Your love and Your life and all the grace and mercy I need this day. I honor You as my King and give every aspect of my life totally and completely to You. I give You my spirit, soul, body, mind, heart, and will. In all that I pray I include \[name your immediate family members] acting as the head of my family I bring them under Your authority and covering. I cover them with Your blood—cover their spirits, souls, bodies, minds, hearts, and wills. I ask Your spirit to restore them in You, renew them in You, apply to them all that I now pray on their behalf. Dear God Holy and victorious Trinity, You alone are worthy of all my worship, my heart’s devotion, my praise, all my trust, and all the glory of my life. I love You, I worship You. I trust You. You alone are life, and You have become my life. I renounce all other Gods and idols \[list those things that you have put your trust in], and I give You the place in my heart and my life that You truly deserve. I confess here and now, God, that this is all about You and not about me. You are the hero of this story, and I belong to You. Forgive me for my every sin. Search me and know me and reveal to me where You are working in my life. In the name of Jesus Christ, I ask You to reveal to me any lies or vows and strongholds that contradict Your word and will. Grant me the grace of Your healing and deliverance and Your deep and true repentance. Thank You for loving me and choosing me before You made the world. I give myself over to You to be one with You in everything, as Jesus is one with You. Thank You for proving Your love by sending Jesus. I receive Him and all His life. Thank You for including me in Christ, for forgiving me my sins, for granting me His righteousness, and for making me complete in Him. Thank You for making me alive with Christ! I bring the life and work of the Lord Jesus Christ over my life today; over my home, my family, my household; over all my kingdom and domain. Jesus, thank You for coming, for being human like me. I love You. I trust You. I worship You. I give myself over to You to be one with You in all things—spirit, soul, body, mind, heart, and will. I receive all the work and triumph of Your cross, death, blood, and sacrifice, through which my every sin is atoned for. I am ransomed and delivered from the kingdom of darkness and transferred to Your kingdom. My sin nature is removed, my heart has been changed by the Holy Spirit, and every claim being made against me is canceled and disarmed this day. I now take my place in Your cross and death, dying with You to sin, to my flesh, to this world. I take up the cross and crucify my pride, arrogance, unbelief, lack of trust and faith \[and anything else you are currently struggling with]. I put off the old \[insert your name here]. Apply to me and my family all the work and triumph of Your blood and sacrifice. I receive it all with thanks and give it total claim to my spirit, soul, body, mind, heart, and will. I bring the blood and sacrifices of Jesus Christ over my life today, over my home, my family, my household, my vehicles, finances, over all my kingdom and domain. I bring the cross, death, blood, and sacrifices of Jesus Christ against Satan, against his kingdom, against every foul and unclean spirit, every foul power. I bring the cross, death, blood and sacrifice of Jesus Christ to the borders of my kingdom and domain, and I stake it there in the name of Jesus Christ. Jesus, I also receive You as my life. I receive all the work and power of Your resurrection through which You have conquered sin, death, judgment, and the enemy. Death has no power over You, nor does any foul thing. I have been raised with You to new life, dead to sin and alive to God. With my family, I take my place now in Your resurrection and in Your life. I receive Your hope, love, joy, goodness, wisdom, power, and strength. Apply to me and my family all the work and triumph in Your resurrection. I bring the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ over my life today; over my home, my family, my household, finances, vehicles; over all my kingdom and domain. I bring the resurrection and the empty tomb of Jesus Christ against Satan, against his kingdom, against every foul and unclean spirit, against every human being and their spirit, their warfare and their household. I bring the resurrection and the empty tomb of the Lord Jesus Christ to the borders of my kingdom and domain and I stake it there in the name of Jesus Christ. Jesus I also receive You as my authority, rule, and dominion. My everlasting victory against Satan and his kingdom and my ability to bring Your kingdom at all times in every way. I receive all the work and triumph of Your ascension through which Satan has been judged and cast down, and all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to You. I take my place now in Your authority and in Your throne which I have been raised by You to the right hand of the Father and established in Your authority. I give myself to You. Apply to me and my family all the work and triumph in Your authority and in Your throne. I give it total claim to my spirit, soul, body, mind, heart, and will. I now bring the authority of Jesus Christ over my life today; over my home, family, household, vehicles, and finances; over all my kingdom and domain. I now bring the authority, rule, and dominion of the Lord Jesus Christ against Satan, against his kingdom, against every foul and unclean spirit—every ruler, power, authority, and spiritual force of wickedness, their every weapon claim and device. \[Name any foul spirits attacking you.] I send all foul and unclean spirits to the foot of the cross for Jesus to deal with, together with every backup and replacement, every weapon, claim, and device, by the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ and in His name. I command the judgment of the Lord Jesus Christ on any spirit that refuses to obey and send them to judgment by the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ and in His name. Holy Spirit, thank You for coming. I love You, I worship You. I trust You. You have clothed me with power on high an sealed me in Christ. You have become my union with the Father, my counselor, comforter, strength and guide. I honor You as Lord and fully give You every aspect of my life totally and completely to You. Fill me, fresh Holy Spirit. Restore my union with the Father and Son. I receive You with thanks and give You total claim to my life. Heavenly Father, thank You for granting to us every spiritual blessing in Christ Jesus. I claim the riches in Christ over my life today and over my family. I bring the blood of Christ once more over each of us—our spirits, souls, bodies, minds, hearts, and wills. I put on the full armor of God. The belt of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, the shoes of the gospel, the helmet of salvation. I take up the shield of faith and the sword of the spirit, and I choose to be strong in the Lord and in the strength of Your might. I declare my dependence on You, and I take my stand against the enemy and all of his lying ways. I choose to believe the truth, and I refuse to be discouraged. You are the God of all hope, and I am confident that You will meet my every need. I ask Your spirit to send people to pray for us. I now call forth the kingdom of God, throughout my home, my household, my kingdom and domain. In the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ. Giving all glory and honor and thanks to Him. In Jesus’s name. Amen."
